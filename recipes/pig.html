        Adding slices of cheddar and sea salt takes this classic pig in a blanket recipe and turns it into a game day favorite that’s totally addicting!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Crescent Rolls</li>
        <li>Beef little smokies or mini beef franks</li>
        <li>cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>dipping sauce</li>
        <li>5 slices cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat and set aside.
        </li>
            <li>Unroll the cans of crescent roll dough and slice along the perforated lines. Then slice each triangle into 3 skinnier triangles. You can just slice them in half if you prefer a bigger roll on your pigs in a blanket, but you’ll only be able to make 36 bites instead of 40.</li>
            <li>Remove the beef little msokies from the package and pat them dry with a paper towel. Slice each cheese slice into 8 pieces about 1-inch x 2-inches each.</li>
            <li>Place a piece of cheese on the larger end of each of the crescent pieces. Place a little beef frank on top of the larger end with the cheese and dough. Then roll up the pigs in a blanket and repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet, placing them at least 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with flaked salt.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the rolls are golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the pigs are baking, prepare the dipping sauce by whisking together the kitchen, mustard, and brown sugar in a small bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Serve the pigs in a blanket warm with the dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
